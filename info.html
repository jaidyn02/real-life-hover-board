  <br />The creators of the hover board are currently working on a new model (as seen in the image) and this
    version looks a bit more advance than the previous models. There is no exact release date (as of 02/24/17)
    for this version and we dont know if this version will hover higher off the ground or have better battery
  life and if there are going to be any more improvements or variations and if they are going to sell
     more.</div>
